The presented code snippet is a well-designed, though somewhat complex, implementation of an HTTP server in C++. It leverages modern C++ features and concepts, demonstrating a high level of proficiency in both C++ and networking principles. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Code Level
- **Advanced**: The code demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of C++ including smart pointers, templates, asynchronous operations, and callbacks. It also shows a thorough understanding of HTTP protocols and TCP/IP networking.

### Described Content
1. **`http_server` Structure**:
   - This class uses `std::enable_shared_from_this` to enable shared ownership semantics.
   - It has a static method `make()` for creating shared instances, following the singleton-like pattern.
   - It includes an `http_router` which maps URLs to callback functions.
   - The `do_start()` method binds the server to a specific address and port, and initiates the asynchronous accept process for incoming connections.

2. **`http_request` and `http_response_writer`**:
   - `http_request` encapsulates the request details including URL, method, and body.
   - It provides a `write_response` method to write the response back to the client.

3. **`http_router`**:
   - It uses a `std::map` to store URL-to-callback mappings, allowing for simple route handling.

4. **`http_connection_handler`**:
   - This class handles the connection and request-response cycle.
   - It uses an `async_file` for asynchronous file operations and a `bytes_buffer` for reading.
   - It employs a parser (`http_request_parser`) and writer (`http_response_writer`) for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### Learning Points
1. **Asynchronous Programming**: Learning how to use `async_file` for non-blocking file operations and how to manage asynchronous callbacks and timeouts is crucial.

2. **Smart Pointers and RAII**: The use of `std::shared_ptr` for managing shared resources and the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom for resource management.

3. **Networking Concepts**: Deep understanding of TCP connections and HTTP protocol handling, including parsing and writing headers, and handling connection timeouts.

4. **Error Handling**: The use of `expected<int>` for error-prone operations and how to handle errors gracefully.

5. **Template Usage**: Understanding advanced template use in `http_request_parser<>` and `http_response_writer<>`.

6. **Concurrency and Callbacks**: Implementing and understanding the use of callbacks within asynchronous operations.

### Takeaways
- **Advanced C++ Features**: Practice with modern C++ features like smart pointers, templates, and RAII.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Mastering asynchronous operations and error handling in networking applications.
- **HTTP and TCP/IP Protocols**: Deepening understanding of HTTP request-response cycles and TCP/IP connection management.

This code is not only a demonstration of advanced programming skills but also a practical example of how to implement a scalable and robust HTTP server in C++. It’s a valuable resource for developers looking to improve in these areas.
